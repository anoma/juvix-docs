# Juvix Blog

Hola and welcome to the Juvix blog! 

Welcome to our cosy corner, where we dive into the world of functional
programming and next-generation distributed apps! We'll be exploring Juvix and
beyond, discussing fascinating aspects and applications. So come on in, and
let's embark on this exciting journey together!

## What can you expect?

Throughout our articles, you'll discover functional programming (FP), and
potentially, implementation notes pertinent to the ongoing development cycles of
Juvix. Our primary objective is to share our insights about Juvix while
encouraging discussions centred on functional programming concepts and
methodologies.
