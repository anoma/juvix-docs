## Explore Juvix: Talk Highlights

During the talk, you'll get an in-depth introduction to [Juvix][juvix], an innovative language for developing next-generation decentralized applications. Juvix combines the strengths of functional languages with efficient compilation to low-level languages like C or LLVM, providing a powerful and transparent coding experience.

Designed with a strong type system and a focus on referential transparency, Juvix incorporates the best features of existing functional languages. We'll explore Juvix's current state, including its compiler phases and language features, and discuss the ongoing development progress and the challenges we face in creating a robust tool for the rapidly evolving world of decentralised applications. With the power of the high-level language Juvix you can grasp on the easier way to create arithmetic circuits for zero-knowledge proofs.

## Engage in the Workshop: Hands-On Experience

In addition to the introductory presentation, we invite you to join our practical workshop session on Juvix. It's an excellent opportunity to dive deeper into Juvix and get hands-on experience.

During the workshop, our team will guide you through creating your first Juvix application. How exciting is that! We'll assist you with installing the Juvix compiler and related tools, provide an overview of the Juvix language, and explore some fascinating Juvix applications.

To get started, simply clone the [workshop GitHub repository][juvix-workshop]. It contains all the necessary instructions to prepare for the workshop in advance. Don't worry if you encounter any questions or challenges along the way â€” we'll be there to support and assist you during the workshop.

## Meet the team

In addition to the talk and workshops, the teams will have a dedicated Namada/Anoma booth at the venue. We'd love for you to stop by, say hi and learn more about the projects. The team would love to hear from you and meet you there.

And, of course, your effort and hard work will be rewarded by the unique merch we will be sharing exclusively with the talk and workshop participants. Join the session, or come find us at the Juvix booth at the conference premises to get some for yourself!

See you in Prague ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿
