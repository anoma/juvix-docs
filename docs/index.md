Juvix is an open-source, constantly evolving functional programming language
designed for writing privacy-preserving decentralized applications. Using Juvix, developers can write high-level programs which can be compiled to WASM directly, or through [VampIR][vampir] to circuits for private execution with [Taiga][taiga] on [Anoma][anoma] or Ethereum.
