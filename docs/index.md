# Welcome to the Juvix documentation!

![Tara](assets/images/tara-smiling.svg){align=right width="300"}

Juvix is an open-source, ever-evolving functional language for creating
privacy-focused decentralized apps. It allows developers to write high-level
programs that compile to WASM or, via [VampIR][vampir], to circuits for private
execution using [Taiga][taiga] on [Anoma][anoma] or Ethereum.

This documentation covers various topics, including a concise introduction to
the Juvix ecosystem, which can be found in the [overview
section](./overview.md).
