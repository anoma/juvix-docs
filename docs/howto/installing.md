# Installing Juvix

## Prerequisites

You need [Clang / LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) version
13 or later. Note that on macOS the preinstalled clang does not support
the `wasm` target, so use e.g. `brew install llvm` instead.

For the `wasm` and `risc0-rust` targets additional optional
dependencies are needed. See
[below](./installing.md#installing-optional-dependencies) for
instructions on how to install them.

## Shell script

We provide a shell script that installs the Juvix compiler binary for Linux and macOS
using the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/anoma/juvix/releases).

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal to install Juvix.

!!! note ""

    ```text
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://get.juvix.org | sh
    ```

!!! tip ""

      In VSCode, install Juvix automatically with the [Juvix VSCode
      extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heliax.juvix-mode).

## MacOS

The easiest way to install Juvix on MacOS is by using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

To install the [homebrew-juvix tap](https://github.com/anoma/homebrew-juvix), run:

```shell
brew tap anoma/juvix
```

To install Juvix, run:

```shell
brew install juvix
```

Helpful information can also be obtained by running:

```shell
brew info juvix
```

## Linux x86_64

A Juvix compiler binary executable for Linux x86_64 is
available on the [Juvix release page](https://github.com/anoma/juvix/releases/latest).

To install this executable, download and unzip the linked file and move
it to a directory on your shell's `PATH`.

For example if `~/.local/bin` is on your shell's `PATH`, you can install
Juvix as follows:

```shell
cd /tmp
curl https://api.github.com/repos/anoma/juvix/releases/latest \
  | grep "browser_download_url.*linux" \
  | cut -d : -f2,3 | tr -d \" \
  | xargs curl -L -o linux_release.zip
unzip linux_release.zip
mv juvix ~/.local/bin/juvix
```

## Building Juvix from source

To install Juvix from source you must clone the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/anoma/juvix.git). Then Juvix can be
installed with the following commands. We assume you have
[Stack](https://haskellstack.org) and [GNU
Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/anoma/juvix.git
cd juvix
make install
```

The C compiler and linker paths can be specified as options to the
`make install` command, e.g.

```shell
make install CC=path/to/clang LIBTOOL=path/to/llvm-ar
```

On macOS, you can alternatively run the following command for Homebrew.
The flag `--HEAD` used below is optional â€“ use it to build the latest
version of Juvix in the `main` branch on GitHub.

```shell
brew install --build-from-source --HEAD juvix --verbose
```

## Building the project with `cabal`

We recommend using the `stack` build tool with this project.

If you prefer the `cabal` build tool instead, then you need to generate
the `juvix.cabal` file using [hpack](https://github.com/sol/hpack)
before running `cabal build`.

You also need to compile the runtime first:

```shell
make runtime
cabal build
```

## Installing optional dependencies

### WebAssembly

If you want to compile to WebAssembly, you need to install:

- [wasmer](https://wasmer.io)
- [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases)
- [wasm-ld](https://lld.llvm.org) - the LLVM linker for WASM (NB: On
  Linux you may need to install the `lld` package; on macOS this is
  installed as part of `llvm`).

To install `wasi-sdk` you need to download `libclang_rt` and
`wasi-sysroot` precompiled archives from the [wasi-sdk release
page](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/) and:

1.  Extract the `libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-*.tar.gz` archive in
    the `clang` installation root (for example `/usr/lib/clang/13` on
    Ubuntu or `` `brew --prefix llvm` `` on macOS).

    For example on macOS with `homebrew clang`:

```shell
cd `brew --prefix llvm`
curl https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-15/libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-15.0.tar.gz -OL
tar xf libclang_rt.builtins-wasm32-wasi-15.0.tar.gz
```

2.  Extract the `wasi-sysroot-*.tar.gz` archive on your local system and
    set `WASI_SYSROOT_PATH` to its path.

    For example:

```shell
cd ~
curl https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-15/wasi-sysroot-15.0.tar.gz -OL
tar xf wasi-sysroot-15.0.tar.gz
export WASI_SYSROOT_PATH=~/wasi-sysroot
```

### RISC Zero

If you want to compile to [RISC Zero](https://risczero.com) via Rust,
using the `risc0-rust` target, you need to have
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and cargo installed. To compile the
Rust code generated by Juvix for RISC Zero, and then generate and verify the
proof, you need to install the [RISC Zero Rust
toolchain](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install).

!!! tip "Checking your setup"

    Run `juvix doctor` in your terminal to validate your setup.
