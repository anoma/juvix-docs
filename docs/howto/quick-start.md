# Quick Start

To install Juvix, follow the instructions in the [installation
guide](./installing.md).

After installation, run `juvix --help` to see the list of commands.

Run Juvix doctor to check your system setup:

```shell
juvix doctor
```

## CLI Usage Examples

Create a new package:

```shell
juvix init
```

Evaluate a source file:

```shell
juvix eval path/to/source.juvix
```

Compile a source file into a native executable:

```shell
juvix compile path/to/source.juvix
```

Compile a source file into a WebAssembly binary:

```shell
juvix compile -t wasm32-wasi path/to/source.juvix
```

Launch the REPL:

```shell
juvix repl
```

Typecheck a source file:

```shell
juvix typecheck path/to/source.juvix
```

Generate HTML representations of a source file and its imports:

```shell
juvix html --recursive path/to/source.juvix
```

## The Hello World example

This is the Juvix source code of the traditional Hello World program.

```juvix
-- HelloWorld.juvix
module HelloWorld;

import Stdlib.Prelude open;

main : IO := printStringLn "hello world!";
```

To compile and run a binary generated by Juvix, save the source code to
a file called `HelloWorld.juvix` and run the following command from the
directory containing it:

```shell
juvix compile HelloWorld.juvix
./HelloWorld
```

You should see the output: `hello world!`

The source code can also be compiled to a WebAssembly binary. This
requires some additional setup. See the [Installation
How-to](./installing.md) for more
information. You can also run `juvix doctor` to check your setup.

```shell
juvix compile --target wasm32-wasi HelloWorld.juvix
wasmer HelloWorld.wasm
```
