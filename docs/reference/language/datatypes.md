# Data types

A data type declaration consists of:

- The `type` keyword,
- a unique name for the type,
- the `:=` symbol, and
- a non-empty list of constructor declarations (functions for
  building the elements of the data type).

The simplest data type is the `Unit` type with one constructor called
`unit`.

```juvix
type Unit := unit : Unit;
```

In the following example, we declare the type `Nat` â€“ the unary
representation of natural numbers. This type comes with two
constructors: `zero` and `suc`.

Example elements of type `Nat`:

- number one represented by `suc zero`
- the number two represented by `suc (suc zero)`
- etc.

```juvix
--8<------ "docs/reference/language/datatypes.juvix:typeNat"
```

Constructors can be used like normal functions or in patterns when
defining functions by [pattern matching](../functions#pattern-matching).
For example, here is a function adding two natural numbers:

```juvix
--8<------ "docs/reference/language/datatypes.juvix:addNat"
```

## Polymorphic data type

A data type can possess type parameters. When a data type has a type parameter
`A`, it is referred to as _polymorphic in_ `A`.

A classic example of this concept is the `List` type, which is polymorphic in
the type of its list elements.

```juvix
--8<------ "docs/reference/language/datatypes.juvix:typeList"
```

The following function determines whether an element is in a list or not.

```juvix
--8<------ "docs/reference/language/datatypes.juvix:elemList"
```

For more examples of inductive types and how to use them, see [the Juvix
standard library](https://anoma.github.io/juvix-stdlib/).
